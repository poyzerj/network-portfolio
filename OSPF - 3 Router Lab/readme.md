# OSPF 3-Router Lab

## 📌 Overview
This lab demonstrates **OSPF adjacency formation, neighbor discovery, and route exchange** using a 3-router straight-line topology. All routers are configured in **Area 0**, and each router uses its **loopback interface as its OSPF router ID**.

Routers:  
- R1 – Router ID: 1.1.1.1  
- R2 – Router ID: 2.2.2.2  
- R3 – Router ID: 3.3.3.3
